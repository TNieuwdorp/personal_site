In this podcast episode with Jon Krohn, I discuss my journey in data engineering and the evolution of Python data processing libraries. We talk about:

- **Introduction to Polars**: High-performance, declarative data frame library for Python.
- **Motivation for the book**: Growing popularity of Polars and need for comprehensive documentation.
- **Performance comparison**: Polars can outperform Pandas, reducing memory usage and computation time.
- **Real-world use at Alliander**: Reduced memory usage from 500 GB to 40 GB, improved processing.
- **Collaboration with Nvidia and Dell**: Benchmarked Polars on GPU, achieving significant performance gains.
- **Data visualization**: Tools like HBplot and Great Tables help create appealing outputs from Polars data frames.
- **Writing process**: Authors share challenges, deadlines, and switching visualization libraries.
- **Book giveaway**: Announcement of a giveaway for signed copies of the book.
